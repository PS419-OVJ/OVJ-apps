# OVJ - Odyssay Van Java Apps

OVJ-Apps : Odyssey Van Java GitHub Repositories of Bangkit Academy 2023 H2 Capstone Project from 3 learning path. Machine Learning, Mobile development, Cloud Computing from team CH2-PS419.

# About The Project
The tourism sector is one of the important sectors that support the Indonesian economy. In 2022, the tourism sector contributed 4.3% to Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) reported that there were 734.86 million domestic tourist (Wisnus) visits in Indonesia in 2022. West Java became the second-ranked province as the main destination for Wisnus in 2022, which amounted to 123.53 million visits.
Even so, the ease of knowing tourist attractions in the western part of Java is still arguably not enough because only through social media, websites and maps that provide incomplete and less integrated information. Not to mention that tourists are not only trying to visit new tourist attractions, but also to learn the culture and history of the places they explore.

As sons of the region, we want to participate in developing tourism in the western part of Java by utilizing the knowledge and experience we learned in Bangkit Academy 2023 program, with an application in the form of tourism place recommendations called the OVJ “Odyssey Van Java” (West of Java) Application. The OVJ “Odyssey Van Java” (West of Java) application is a tourism recommendation application in the western Java region, this application provides tourism recommendations according to user preferences and provides information that has been integrated using machine learning models, so that tourists can easily find tourist destinations according to what they want.

# Mobile Devlopment Path
Creating apps with the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/). To manage every aspect of an Android data connection to the internet, [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is used. utilizing [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=id) to authenticate login and registration systems and store user data. Obtaining the user's present location via [Google Services](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=id)

# App Development roadmap
We use multiple processes in the application creation process, which we divide into two processes: Implementation to Design and Implementation to Applications.

# Implementation to Design
We use the web-based application [Figma](figma.com) for the application design process.

# Implentation to Apps
Following the design phase, we used Android Studio and the[Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/) to continue creating applications. We implemented the UI Design that had been created earlier and processed to become a real application, then we offer a number of features, including To manage every aspect of an Android data connection to the internet, [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is used. utilizing [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=id) to authenticate login and registration systems and store user data. Obtaining the user's present location via [Google Services](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=id).
