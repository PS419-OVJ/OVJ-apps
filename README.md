# Mobile Devlopment Path
creating apps with the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/). To manage every aspect of an Android data connection to the internet, [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is used. utilizing [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=id) to authenticate login and registration systems and store user data. Obtaining the user's present location via [Google Services](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=id)

# App Development roadmap
We use multiple processes in the application creation process, which we divide into two processes: Implementation to Design and Implementation to Applications.

# Implementation to Design
We use the web-based application [Figma](figma.com) for the application design process.

#Implentation to Apps
Following the design phase, we used Android Studio and the[Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/) to continue creating applications. We implemented the UI Design that had been created earlier and processed to become a real application, then we offer a number of features, including To manage every aspect of an Android data connection to the internet, [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is used. utilizing [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=id) to authenticate login and registration systems and store user data.
