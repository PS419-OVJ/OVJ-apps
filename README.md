# Machine Learning Path
### Description
The Odyssey Van Java app serves as a tourism recommendation platform specifically tailored for the western Java region. This application offers personalized tourism suggestions based on user preferences and delivers integrated information through machine learning models. This ensures that travelers can effortlessly discover destinations that align with their preferences.

### Content-based Filtering
Content-based machine learning is employed to generate recommendations by analyzing the characteristics of items and user preferences. The process involves creating profiles for each item and user within the same feature space, followed by assessing similarity using metrics like dot product or cosine similarity. The system then suggests items that exhibit the highest similarity to the user's profile.

### Dataset
We gathered a tourism destination dataset containing the names of tourist spots, categories, locations, operating hours, ticket prices, and descriptions for each destination. 
We also distributed questionnaires to travelers to collect data on each individual's travel preferences.

### Model
We developed a machine learning model using the Python libraries TensorFlow and Keras, specifically crafting a tourism recommendation system model. Utilizing both the tourism destination dataset and individual travel preference data, we implemented these into the created model.
